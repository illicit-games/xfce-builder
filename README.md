# xfce-builder

The idea for xfce-builder is too create a minimal build script using live-build using being efficient and focus on productivity while keeping a minimal installation base. This also includes clameras as i do install this on my personal devices and have been working on this for awhile as its usable for a drop in replacement for windows if all is required is a bit of installations vs purely dependows only thanks microsoft, developers and derps.


# Debian Trixie

I foucsed on using bleeding edge more or less in my personal devices if you want to call trixie or Debian Testing Codename (Trixie) the next installment after Bookworm reaches its time, I used this for the latest Kernel among other improvements that where readiliy available AMD, INTEL, NVIDA out of the box due to the new kernel.

The fact its stable with minimal issues using xfce as a base desktop, while removing many unneeded junk vs the offical installer with office-software, image-software and various other crap i hardly ever use in my field of work outside of creating documention when i do this i use Typora a very nice markdown editor. Should be using it to type this up but kind of busy at the moment people wanted me to explain what this was. Sorry irc folks my bad.

# software choices

  Why this over that?
  
  - pcmanfm because i perfer it over thunar.
  - terminator, because xfce4-terminal is annoying to multitask with many servers, console checks, monitoring the list goes on i do a lot of terminal based stuff on a daily both work and play similar to here?
  - firefox, because i like firefox about it? privacy, ads, tracking prevention while still staying mostly usable across sites is why.
  - Other stuff ill have to label why later.
